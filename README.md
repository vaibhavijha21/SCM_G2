Github practical
Theory :-
A .gitignore file tells Git which files and directories to ignore, preventing
unnecessary or sensitive files (e.g., logs, temporary files, or credentials) from
being committed.
A README.md file provides an overview of the project, including its purpose,
installation steps, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines. It helps users
and developers understand and navigate the repository efficiently.
